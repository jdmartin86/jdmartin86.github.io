<p>I spend a good deal of my free time in pursuit of alpine climbing objectives. Here I recount some of my more noteable trips. My hope is that the information can be of some use to those looking to repeat the climbs.</p>

            <div><p><span class="newthought">Pinnacle Gully</span>  is a relatively narrow passageway of steep ice on Mount Washington. The route begins at Huntington Ravine and terminates in the alpine garden, just a forty-minute walk back down to the tree line. The climb consists of three rope-stretching pitches. (Bring a 70m rope if you like to wander.) It goes without saying that conditions will depend on the season. In February, we experienced ice of varying quality: from young ice that was soft and would hold an entire pick, to brittle glassy sheets that shattered with a tap. There was also the occasional flow of water running underneath that kept us moving forward. But for the most part, the ice was thick, and we felt secure with all of our placements. </p>
