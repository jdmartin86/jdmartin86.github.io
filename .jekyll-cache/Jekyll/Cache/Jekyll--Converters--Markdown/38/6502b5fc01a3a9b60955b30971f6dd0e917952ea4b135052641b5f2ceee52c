<p><strong>March 13, 2020:</strong> Today I am showcasing my work on uncertainy-aware decision making as part of the <a href="https://www.nyas.org/events/2020/14th-annual-machine-learning-symposium/">New York Academy of Sciences’ 14th annual Machine Learning Symposium</a>. [<a href="/assets/posters/2020-martin_etal-poster.pdf">poster</a>]</p>

<p><strong>January 27, 2020:</strong> I am thrilled to announce that I will be working at <a href="https://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a> in Edmonton, Canada, as a research intern with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G3pvUNEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Joseph Modayil</a>. There I plan to study catastrophic intereference and methods for improving continual reinforcement learning.</p>

<p><strong>November 4, 2019:</strong> Visiting MIT to connect with <a href="https://tixiaoshan.github.io">Tixiao Shan</a> at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">CSAIL</a> and learn about the <a href="http://roboat.org">Roboat project</a>. I’m giving a short talk to the group about my recent work.</p>

<p><strong>October 22, 2019:</strong> I’m giving a talk at <a href="http://deepmind.com">DeepMind</a> in Edmonton, Canada, about how RL agents can benefit from organizing their experience into contexts.</p>

<p><strong>October 7, 2019:</strong> Two of my projects will appear as NeurIPS workshop papers this year.  </p>

<p><strong>September 18, 2019:</strong> I’m giving a talk about the disparate impacts of alpine climbing as part of the <a href="https://americanalpineclub.org">American Alpine Club</a>’s Story Swap in Philadelphia <a href="https://www.phillychapter-aac.org/journal/2019/9/06/john">[link]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>August 30, 2019:</strong> I’m giving a talk at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/robotics/">Google Robotics</a> in New York City on exploiting transition invariance for efficient Reinforcement Learning in multi-stage settings.</p>

<p><strong>July 19, 2019:</strong> I was featured in the journal of the <a href="https://americanalpineclub.org">American Alpine Club</a>’s Philadelphia chapter, as part of my work with their winter mountaineering mentorship program <a href="https://www.phillychapter-aac.org/journal/2019/6/29/mentoring-program-spotlight-john-martin">[link]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>March 14, 2019:</strong> I’m excited to announce that I will be working at <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain">Google Brain</a> in Montréal, Canada, as a research intern with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uyYPun0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en#">Marc G. Bellemare</a>’s group. There I will study methods for continual reinforcement learning in deep neural networks, focusing on settings with non-stationary data.</p>
