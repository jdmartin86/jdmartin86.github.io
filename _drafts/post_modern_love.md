#  [Post] Modern Love
## A retrospective on Bowie

* Modern Love was about Bowie's feelings on love. 
* What is post modernism
	* No limits or boundaries 
	* Unconventional, avant garde perhaps
	* More freedom, less boundaries, valuing individuality 
	* It questions standard beliefs on any topic and emphasizes the subjective experience
	* Can be described by an attitude or skeptism or rejection of grand narratives of modern idealogy 
	* Frequently call to attention the socially-conditioned nature of thinking and culture
* How was Modern Love the song about post modern love?
* This is not a new interpretation. Bowie is known for being a post modern character. 

Bowie was very much a post-modern rock star, and Modern Love exemplifies those values with a song about romance. In the song Bowie shares his opinion on love and romance. 

This appeared on his Let's Dance album. The album received mixed critical reviews. Many claimed it was artistically void and it appealed mainly to the masses. Although I'm no art critic, I wouldn't go that quite that far. There are songs that are certainly worth unpacking. And when you do, there is much to appreciate. In this post, I'll take a look at the song Modern Love. 

Modern Love describes Bowie's post-modernist take on love. 

Bowie had a unconventional view on love for some time, having married a woman () but remained in an open relationship for sometime, then coming out as exclusively homosexual for some years before going back to women.
