**January 27, 2020:** I am thrilled to announce that I will be working at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com) in Edmonton, Canada, as a research intern with [Joseph Modayil](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G3pvUNEAAAAJ&hl=en). There I plan to study perception and discovery in the context of continual reinforcement learning.

**November 4, 2019:** Visiting MIT to connect with [Tixiao Shan](https://tixiaoshan.github.io) at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu) and learn about the [Roboat project](http://roboat.org). I'm giving a short talk to the group about my recent work. 

**October 22, 2019:** I'm giving a talk at [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com) in Edmonton, Canada, about how RL agents can benefit from organizing their experience into contexts.

**October 7, 2019:** Two of my projects will appear as NeurIPS workshop papers this year.   
   * [Saftey and Robust Decison Making Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/neurips19-safe-robust-workshop#h.p_iF36C6BL_elR): Stochastically Dominant Distributional Reinforcement Learning, **John D. Martin**,  Michal Lyskawinski, Xiaohu Li, Brendan Englot.
