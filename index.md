I am a Research Scientist at Intel AI and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Alberta.

My goal is to establish conceptual, mathematical, and algorithmic foundations for the science of artificial intelligence.  Â 

I value conceptually-grounded work with empirical cash-value. I often approach problems from first principles, by translating philosophical ideas into mathematical terms which can be analyzed with computational experiments.
