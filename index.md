I am a Fellow at the Openmind Research Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

My goal is to develop the foundations for a science of artificial minds. 

Much of my work focuses on how the phenomena of mind can be understood with computation and reinforcement learning. I value research that brings definition to important aspects of our lived experience, and theory that cashes out with empirical impact.
