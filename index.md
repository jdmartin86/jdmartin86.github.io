I am a Fellow of the [Openmind Research Institute](https://www.openmindresearch.org/) and an Adjunct Professor at the University of Alberta. 

I want to understand how the mind works and bring definition to its core phenomena. I draw inspiration from my peers across computer science, cognitive studies, and philosophy to develop algorithms and theories with empirical value.

My research is typically framed with concepts from reinforcement learning. Currently, I am thinking about the relationship between computation and agency. Can learning agents leverage the dynamics of their environment for computational benefit? Does computation influence the range of an agent's experiences? 

Over the years I have studied a broad range of topics: the expressivity of rewards ([link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bowling23a/bowling23a.pdf)), meta-learning efficient planning strategies ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19561)), organizing unstructured sense data ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09776)), distributional RL ([link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/martin20a/martin20a.pdf)). I have also studied various applied problems in chip design, robotics, and aviation. Long ago I helped build [the world's first full-scale autonomous helicopter](https://vtol.org/awards-and-contests/vertical-flight-society-award-winners?awardID=5).   

Here is a [formal bio](/intro/index.html) that can be used to introduce me.
