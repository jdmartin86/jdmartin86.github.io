<!-- <img src="/assets/img/profile.png" alt="Profile" width="200" height="250" style="float: left;"> -->

I am a Fellow at the Openmind Research Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

My goal is to develop and understand the computational foundations of artificial minds. 

Much of my work focuses on how mental phenomena can be understood with computation and reinforcement learning. I value research that brings definition to important aspects of our lived experience, and theory that cashes out with empirical impact.
