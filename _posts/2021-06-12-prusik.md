{% newthought 'Prusik Peak' %} is located in the Core zone of the Enchantments. The West Ridge has a few pitches of low fifth-class climbing, with a short section of unprotected friction slab as its crux.

Our goal was to climb it in a single car-to-car excursion. Unfortunatley when we arrived the ridge was soaking wet from snow melt and rain. 
Any chance of maintaining friction on the third pitch seemed unlikely, so we decided to bail with the intention to come back later in the season.

Nevertheless, we managed to have a long day outside and get some nice photos in the process.
