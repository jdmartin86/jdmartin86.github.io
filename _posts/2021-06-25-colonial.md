{% newthought 'Colonial Peak' %} is located in the North Cascades, about six or so miles off Highway 20.
Colonial isn't very tall by local standards; it's only 7,771ft tall. But the peak should by no means be underestimated. 
The main route has one of the most brutal approaches I've ever experienced. 
And for some reason we decided to climb this car-to-car on the hottest day of the heatwave.

Struggling to find an alternative way up, we essentially circumnavigated the summit, finally giving up after cliffing out on the ridge above.

Managed to snap some photos of the surrounding peaks.
