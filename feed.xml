        <title>Scientific Styles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Allen Newell&lt;/span&gt;  (AI pioneer and Turing Award winner​) once shared his thoughts on the style of scientific practice. Even today his observations are helpful, particularly as we revisit our own styles and choose new research topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newell’s ideas can be found in the excerpt below. This was originally taken from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amturing.acm.org/pdf/NewellTuringTranscript.pdf&quot;&gt;retrospective talk&lt;/a&gt; he gave at CMU on December 4, 1991. I came across the excerpt while browsing the ML Theory channel on Amii’s Slack, after Csaba gave a general talk on the subject. Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;epigraph&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I said I will reflect not just on my career, but on sort of scientific styles, which might be interesting to the group at hand, since most of you are [​sic​] either haven’t yet adopted a scientific style, or probably don’t like the one that you’re in. So, let’s talk about scientific style. Styles of scientific lives. There are a bunch of floating maxims around when we do this. The maxim associated with this slide is “To each scientific life, its own style, but each style defines a separate life”. OK. So, I want to just talk about different styles because I only exhibit one of these and there are lots of other styles.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, the first one is the one I actually associate with algorithm complexity theorists, which I call a “nomadic existence”. Turns out that it’s easy to prove theorems and it’s very hard to prove theorems that are not almost like the theorems everybody else has proved. So, every so often in complexity theory someone proves a really new interesting theorem which opens up a new area, and then everybody picks up their tents and they all run over into this new area. And they pick up all the interesting nuggets around, and pretty soon you’ll look around and there’s nothing around except nuggets that are like everybody else’s nuggets. And finally, somebody gets a new one. Everyone picks up their tents. OK. And that’s the way you live your life. OK. You live your life moving from one theoretical area to another as it opens up.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The second kind of scientific style is sort of a general substantive theme. Gordon Bell actually has a pretty interesting thing, although he’s moved a little bit. He really played out the first half of his career understanding what the nature of computer architectures was. That has shifted for the last 15 or 20 years into understanding multiprocessors. He’s not focused on any particular thing. There is no particular machine that he wants to build. He wants to understand the space of multiprocessors and how to build effective multiprocessors. That is, in one sense, a kind of a lifetime effort of his. Although when I talked to him recently he was sort of running out of gas and asking what to do next.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is another style that’s quite different, which I’ve labeled a sequence of strategic objectives. A kind of paradigm example was a scientist I knew about twenty years ago by the name of Werner Reichardt, who at the time I knew him, was studying the control system in insects that governed their flight. His view of the world — he was very articulate — was that you pick a particular scientific idea. That idea takes of the order of five years to build up and get deep enough so you really can do something, and then you pick another one. So, life for Werner is a sequence of five years, nominally five years project. Each one picked by looking at the state of science at the time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are in fact — their number is legion — a number of people, and I see lots of them around here, for whom the goal is simply to work on interesting problems. OK. You simply, in fact, if you can work on interesting problems, that’s all you ask of each particular day. There’s another variation on this, which is not so pleasant, in which you look at whatever seems publishable. You see a little project in life that looks like it’s publishable, let’s go for that one. OK. And I know a number of people whose scientific lives are a random walk among the publishable materials. [laughter] They, of course, shall all be nameless.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The last style I want to discuss is a single ultimate scientific question in which a scientist adopts a real goal out there, a scientific goal. I have three examples. Herb Simon is now famous for the fact that a single scientific goal of understanding how it is that humans, who are governed by bounded rationality, how all of the phenomena surrounding human cognition and decision making, can be understood by that. That in fact has driven his entire scientific career.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I haven’t checked this one out with Raj, but my belief about Raj is that he really has speech recognition as his only fundamental scientific goal. OK. Now Raj does lots of different things. He works on multimedia, works on vision, he’s worked on robotics. Only when he turns back to speech do you see sort of fantastic and interesting things happen. And he keeps coming back to it. So, for Raj, I infer — and I repeat, I didn’t ask him — I infer that his life is not all those things. It is really speech as the thing that he wants to really see done with his scientific life.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And for myself, I’m again one of these types of characters. My style is to deal with a single problem, namely the nature of the human mind. That is the one problem that I have cared about throughout my scientific career. And it will last me all the way, all the way to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer&gt;Allen Newell, &lt;cite&gt;&quot;Desires and Diversions&quot;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Alpental Falls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Alpental Falls&lt;/span&gt;  is a single pitch flow of WI2+ across from the ski resort.
Early in the season the ice is brittle and poorly formed.
Still, we decidied to give it a shot, and the outcome was as sketchy as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Colonial Peak (First Attempt)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Colonial Peak&lt;/span&gt;  is located in the North Cascades, about six or so miles off Highway 20.
Colonial isn’t very tall by local standards; it’s only 7,771ft tall. But the peak should by no means be underestimated. 
The main route has one of the most brutal approaches I’ve ever experienced. 
And for some reason we decided to climb this car-to-car on the hottest day of the heatwave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Colonial Peak.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-5.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Moving across the first exposed snowfield.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-10.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Beckey route goes up the big snow field on the left.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-8.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Snowfield Peak.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-11.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Struggling to find an alternative way up, we essentially circumnavigated the summit, finally giving up after cliffing out on the ridge above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;View of the summit and Diablow Lake below.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-14.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking on these slippery choss piles was quite a challenge in mountaineering boots.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-15.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-12.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-colonial/colonial-13.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed to snap some photos of the surrounding peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prusik Peak (First Attempt)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Prusik Peak&lt;/span&gt;  is located in the Core zone of the Enchantments. The West Ridge has a few pitches of low fifth-class climbing, with a short section of unprotected friction slab as its crux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to climb it in a single car-to-car excursion. Unfortunatley when we arrived the ridge was soaking wet from snow melt and rain. 
Any chance of maintaining friction on the third pitch seemed unlikely, so we decided to bail with the intention to come back later in the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we managed to have a long day outside and get some nice photos in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lover&apos;s Lane on Lane Peak</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Lane Peak&lt;/span&gt;  is a devilish-looking mountain, located in the Tatoosh range of Washington’s Cascade mountains. Lover’s Lane is a narrow snow gully that runs up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan and I started our approach from the Narada Falls parking lot, shortly after the Longmire gate opened at 9AM. The skies were clear, and the temperature was in the high thirties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lane Peak. Lover&apos;s Lane is the left-most gully.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-lane/lane-main.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the parking lot, ascend the slope up to the road above. Follow the road to the right until it starts to bend to the left. Enter the forrest and trek downhill until the ground levels out, and you reach a clearing. Head toward the moutain, which will be on your right. Make sure to find a reasonable place to cross the stream on your left before making your way to the bottom of the slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The first clearing. Look at that untouched snow.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-lane/lane-approach-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;approach2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;approach2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-lane/lane-approach-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had skis for this approach!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-climb&quot;&gt;The Climb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gully has a few places to put gear. We simulclimbed about half the route, until we could throw a sling around a tree, located at climber’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed with a running belay after that. Dan put in three knifeblades. One of which I dropped and lost, and the other I couldn’t remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very top of the route is marked by a tree. Folks use this to rapp into the Zipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;descent&quot;&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we were running short of time, we decided to rapp the ascent gully. Two double-rope rappels got us most of the way down. From there, we downclimbed the rest and followed our tracks back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rapping the gully.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2021-lane/lane-descent.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its appearance from far away, this route was relatively mild. I definitely reccomend it as a day trip, especially to those looking to knock off some seasonal rust or hone in their ski-mountaineering skills.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pinnacle Gully on Mount Washington</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Pinnacle Gully&lt;/span&gt;  is a relatively narrow passageway of steep ice on Mount Washington. The route begins at Huntington Ravine and terminates in the alpine garden, just a forty-minute walk back down to the tree line. The climb consists of three rope-stretching pitches. (Bring a 70m rope if you like to wander.) It goes without saying that conditions will depend on the season. In February, we experienced ice of varying quality: from young ice that was soft and would hold an entire pick, to brittle glassy sheets that shattered with a tap. There was also the occasional flow of water running underneath that kept us moving forward. But for the most part, the ice was thick, and we felt secure with all of our placements. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went up on a cold day. The temperature was about -2F at 5:00am when we arrived at Pinkham Notch. The staff in the visitor center had just posted a new weather report from the summit station. Windchill was reported to be -45F with speeds around 40mph. After a bit of discussion, we all agreed the speeds were manageable, but that the chill was too low for the gear we brought. We decided to wait until 10am before leaving – figuring it would take us two hours to approach, and by then the wind advisory would be lifted to a balmy -35F. Around 8:00am we got bored and started our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Pinnacle Gully resides to left of the buttress centered in the image. Central is the large gully to its right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2020-pinnacle/approach.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get there, follow signs to Huntington Ravine. From Huntington, find Central Gully. This will be the widest and most obvious gully to spot from the clearing. On the other side of Central’s left buttress, Pinnacle Gully will be hidden in the morning shade. To reach the first pitch, ascend the small snow slope and hang left. Be mindful here, as the high winds in this area can form layers of &lt;em&gt;wind slab&lt;/em&gt;, which is a crust of hardened snow that can be unstable. We avoided this by remaining close to the rock. Our first belay station was on the leftside of the gully, at the boundary of ice and snow.&lt;label for=&quot;pitch1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;pitch1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/2020-pinnacle/route.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking up the route.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-climb&quot;&gt;The Climb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;belay1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;belay1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/2020-pinnacle/belay1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking down the lower slopes from the first belay. Burrrr. Hurry up, Adam!&lt;/span&gt;
The first pitch is by far the steepest and most technical. Starting from the gully’s left side, we traversed right to gain an entry point onto the wet ice. This is where we could see lots of running water. The soft ice persisted as the climbing got steeper, but eventually we were rewarded with some large bulbs of thick hard ice. Here is where we placed our longest screws, and where our tools were afforded us the best purchase. We pressed on higher and higher, increasingly mindful of the considerable exposure accumulating behind us. The climbing remained difficult and sustained until about 30ft of low-angle snow led us to the next belay station. If you can make it this far, then the rest of the climbing will seem fairly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adam leading pitch 1. Notice the wind slab beginning to seperate in the lower rightside of the image.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2020-pinnacle/pitch1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second belay station is on the left side of the gully. We found the red cord easy to spot from below, and we all felt an incredible sense of relief clipping ourselves into an anchor fastened by three pitons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dan leading pitch 2. How many peices of dropped gear can you spot?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2020-pinnacle/pitch2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
The climbing can be divided in two sections: the snow slope leading up to the ice, and then everything after that. I would rate this pitch at about WI-2. More advanced climbers may feel comfortable soloing up to meet the ice. This could be advantageous by freeing up more rope to find the third anchor. We pitched this section out and, after running out the full 60m of rope, never found the the anchor others report to have used. Maybe it was frozen under ice someplace. Who knows. Instead, we built a rock anchor using two cams. Nobody trusted this to hold more than a belay device. So any fall would have probably zippered the gear. In retrospect, we could have hammered in snow stakes if we had them. The snow felt solid enough up there to support a fall.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone arrived to our delicate anchor, we didn’t see a compelling reason to clip in. We decided instead to just unrope and solo the last pitch. It was all snow and pretty easy going. We daggered our way up the gully’s left side, avoiding the obvious fracture lines of wind slab. We stopped before gaining the crest, to get one last drink of water before suffering through the extreme wind in the alpine garden. The extreme conditions here should not be underestimated. Every time I top out in the alpine garden, I descend as fast as I can, following the carins and not stopping until I reach Lion’s Head trail at the treeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;descent&quot;&gt;Descent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Head’s trail next to Tuckerman’s Ravine is the standard route for most climbers, unless you plan to traverse the mountain to continue onward. Keep your crampons on and use a single axe for the steeper sections. This may seem obvious, but inevitably a queue will begin to form on busier days, because somebody doesn’t have the right gear and instead has to clutch onto every nearby branch to descend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion Pinnacle Gully is one of the most fun and engaging alpine climbs in North East. It’s straightforward to find and simple to navigate as a climber. However, it requires considerable stamina and climbers to apply non-trivial technique over snow, ice, and rock – a throughly enjoyable climb that merits many celebratory beers once it’s complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
