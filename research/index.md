<!-- 
My research aims to understand the mind through computation and mathematics. I believe fundamental work in this area can contribute to a future where AI systems are understandable, reliable, and safe---perhaps also one of greater rationality. Some of my favorite subjects to explore currently relate to reinforcement learning, goal specification, computation, and the philosophy of science. -->
